# Day Planner

Poor time management can result in missed meetings and deadlines or create the appearance of unprofessionalism. This daily planner (https://jason714.github.io/Day-Planner/) allows you to see your day at a glance, schedule time effectively, and improve productivity. It lets you enter to-do items and save them so that they'll be there whenever you open the app. The to-do area of the app is color coded to let you know if a task is something for the future, present or the deadline has past. Upcoming tasks will be highlighted in green, tasks to be worked on now in red and overdue tasks in gray. Also th current day/date is displayed at the bottom of the header section.
